1.1 Functional

TCF001: Accessory must support a MFi authentication mechanism.

TCF002: Accessory must contain a method to reset the accessory to factory settings (e.g., button or UI element).

TCF003: When submitting materials for Accessory Compliance Verification, the Licensee must provide instructions for per-
forming a firmware update on the Accessory Compliance Questionnaire. Licensee must also provide samples that can receive
a firmware update and meet all other requirements specified by the Packing List.

TCF004: Verify accessory information (such as accessory name, advertisement information, manufacturer name, model name,
characteristic values, etc.) does not contain any Apple trademarks. Refer to the Apple Trademark List (https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-
property/trademark/appletmlist.html) for more information.

TCF005: Accessory setup code must appear inside accessoryʼs product packaging. If space allows, accessory setup code
should be printed on accessory.

TCF006: Verify setup code label meets the requirements as indicated in the Works with Apple HomeKit Identity Guidelines
document available in the MFi Portal.

TCF007: QR code or NFC code must be able to be scanned and successfully added to the home.

TCF008: Setup code must be non-trivial, with 8 digits.

TCF012: Accessory must reject pair-setup from a new controller when it is already paired.

TCF013: Accessory should not send notifications when the characteristicʼs value has not changed.

TCF015: The accessory must always successfully unregister event notifications on every characteristic when a controller
deregisters for notifications after having subscribed multiple times.

TCF020: If the accessory has services that include “target state” and “current state” characteristics, the current state char-
acteristic value must be updated when the target state is reached.

TCF022: For accessories that support a service that includes the “on” characteristic. Verify that the correct state is reflected
on the controller after power cycling the accessory.

TCF023: Accessory must always be reachable.

2021-12-9 | Copyright © 2021 Apple Inc. All Rights Reserved.

TCF032: If accessory utilizes services containing characteristics that expose a transient state between target and current
characteristic, changing the target characteristic state must not cause the current state characteristic to misrepresent physical
state of accessory or prevent eventual matching of final set target characteristic state (given no mechanical failure).

TCF033: Accessory must handle multiple admin controllers.

TCF034: Admin controller should be able to modify controller permissions.

TCF036: Setup codes must be unique and not derived from public information. If accessory can display a dynamic setup code,
it must not be manufactured with a setup code in any form (i.e., inside accessory packaging or on accessory itself), it must
generate a new setup code each time it is needed and it must generate setup codes from a cryptographically secure random
number generator.

TCF039: The information encoded in the setup payload is a URI with the following format:
X-HM://<Setup Payload encoding>
For R15 or earlier specifications:
The setup payload encoding contains the following information:
<VersionCategoryFlagsAndSetupCode><SetupID>
For R16 or later specifications:
The setup payload header encoding contains the following information:
<VersionCategoryFlagsAndSetupCode>
The payload data encoding contains the following information:
<SetupIDProductNumber><EUIProductNumber>

WAC, IP, and BLE flags must correctly indicate the capabilities of the accessory.

TCF040: Setup payload should be scannable from the NFC tag when the accessory is not powered on.

TCF041: The Setup ID is persistent across reboots and factory reset of the accessory. This identifier must be different than the
DeviceID, serial number, model or accessory name and must be random and unique for each accessory instance manufactured
by an accessory manufacturer.

TCF042: Accessories must not allow payloads to be written to their NFC tags via NDEF.

TCF043: Programmable NFC tags must leave pairing mode after 5 minutes of inactivity, and move to “Not in pairing mode”.
The accessory must require users to explicitly trigger NFC pairing mode via a physical interaction on the accessory. Pair-setup
can still be allowed after the 5 minute timer expires. Accessories implementing programmable NFC must not implicitly be ready
to pair once all pairings have been removed.

TCF044: Accessories must not support both QR and NFC setup payload retrieval modes.

TCF045: The accessory must only have a single valid setup code at a time across NFC, QR, and 8-digit setup modes.

TCF046: If the connection is closed after pair-setup M2, a subsequent pair-setup must succeed.

TCF047: If the connection is closed after pair-setup M4, a subsequent pair-setup must succeed.

TCF053: Accessory must be able to boot and work with HomeKit without Internet access. If Internet access is blocked for an
accessory, it can rely on the presence of a local NTP server advertised via DHCP.

TCF054: Accessories must stop advertising within 10 minutes of the last pairing attempt while still in unpaired state. Acces-
sories must require a user action such as a power cycle, reset, button press or other explicit user action for the accessory to
re-enter pairing mode and advertise as an unpaired accessory.

TCF001 Accessory must support a MFi authentication mechanism.

Applies to all accessories. Perform this test case automatically with HCA. Below are steps that can be used
to perform this test case manually in HAT.

1. Pair and discover accessory.

2. For HAP over Wi-Fi or Ethernet accessories: in the Discovery view of the trace window, find the Bonjour

Record for the accessory and verify the “Pairing Feature Flags” section.

3. For HAP over BLE accessories: in the HAP Procedures view of the trace window, find the Read Re-
sponse for the “Pairing Features” characteristic that occurs during pair-setup. Please note: this char-
acteristic does not support Paired Read and is read prior to establishing a secure session when per-
forming pair-setup within HAT.

4. For HAP over Thread accessories: in the Thread Discovery view of the trace window, find the Bonjour

Record for the accessory and verify the “Pairing Feature Flags” section.

5. Verify Pairing Features is set to 0x01 for Supports MFi Auth IC or 0x02 for Supports Software Authen-

tication.

6. For software token-based authentication, select the accessory server in the “Controllers” window.
In the “Pairing” section, click “Get Authentication Token” and then “Get Server Information.” In the
“Events” trace view, verify both operations completed successfully.

TCF002 Accessory must contain a method to reset the accessory to factory settings (e.g., button or UI element).

Applies to all accessories. Perform this test case with HAT using the steps below.

1. Pair and discover accessory with HAT.

TCHDS001: Verify that if no message is received before the 10 second timeout, or if the accessory received any other message
from the controller, that the accessory closes the socket.

TCHDS002: Verify that the accessory can support multiple HDS connections. If the accessory supports more HAP over TCP
sessions than it does HDS over TCP connections, accessory must respond to the Start Command with TLV item 0x01 (Status)
with a value of “2” (Busy) when the max number of HDS session is reached.

TCHDS003: Accessories that support HomeKit Data Stream over Wi-FI or Ethernet must be able to establish a Data Stream
Transport session.

TCHDS004: If the accessory has multiple pending connections, and there is ambiguity in which controller is connecting, (e.g.
it provides the same port in all setup requests), it must attempt decrypting the first packet with each key that is a possible
match. If none match, then it must close the socket since it received a connection that did not have a valid hello request as
its first message. If a key is tested but is not a match, the nonce for that key must not be changed, so that when the actual
controller with that key connects, that key is still usable.

TCHDS005: The TCP port range for HomeKit Data Stream must be >= 32768.
